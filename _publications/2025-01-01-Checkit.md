### Abstract
The CheckIt framework is an open educational technology for authoring randomized exercises, banks, and assessments for mathematics. Technological means facilitate the easy sharing and modification of open-source templates and generators authored in the framework to be used both in classrooms as well as to support educational research; case studies in this paper illustrate its use in both contexts, and describe its use in both small and large classrooms.
