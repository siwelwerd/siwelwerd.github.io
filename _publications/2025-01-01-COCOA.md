### Abstract
As demand for open education resources (OER) grows among instructors, methods of supporting OER authors that leverage new technologies and toolkits are needed to support this growing community. In this article, we describe our Community-based, Open source, Continuous OER Authoring (COCOA) model of OER development. In addition to describing the model in the abstract, we also detail the software and services we are currently using to support authoring teams using this model and provide reflections on the relative strengths and challenges this model presents.
