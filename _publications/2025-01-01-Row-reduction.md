### Abstract
In this lesson analysis, the topic of the lesson is using operations to calculate the Reduced Row Echelon Form of a matrix. The course context is an introductory linear algebra course taught using Team-Based Inquiry Learning. The instructional challenges we seek to address are: (1) Students often do not see the reasons for why the RREF is a desirable form for a matrix, or why performing row operations is a reasonable thing to do to a matrix; and (2) Students tend to think about row reduction as a computation/algorithm, and we want to shift them into a reasoning/sense making stance about the problem. To address these challenges, we use an approach grounded in Inquiry-Based Learning. Students begin by identifying a set of operations that preserves the solution set of a linear system, and then build intuition around the idea that one linear system may look easier to solve than another even though they have the same solution set, motivating the definition of reduced row echelon form. Students then practice determining if a matrix is in RREF and, if not, identifying row operations that bring it closer to its final RREF.
