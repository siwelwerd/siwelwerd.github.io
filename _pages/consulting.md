I am currently working as an independent consultant. Areas of expertise include math education, inquiry-based learning, Team-Based Learning, inclusive teaching, and alternative grading.  Some recent topics I have consulted on are:

* Faculty development to support redesign of the Calculus sequence
* Serving in an advisory capacity for grants in education related areas
* One-on-one consultations with faculty on implementing alternative grading in their course

I also frequently give workshops/presentations on the aforementioned topics, most often in a faculty development context.  Recent workshops include:

* Team-Based Inquiry Learning
* Active Learning in Mathematics
* Course Policies and Practices for Inclusive Teaching
* Collaborative Learning in Mathematics Classrooms
* Promoting Wellbeing in STEM Classrooms
* Rehumanizing Assessment: Outcomes-Based Grading 
* An Introduction to Team-Based Learning
