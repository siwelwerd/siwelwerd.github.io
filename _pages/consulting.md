I am currently working as an independent consultant. Areas of expertise include math education, inquiry-based learning, Team-Based Learning, inclusive teaching, open education resources, and alternative grading.  Some recent topics I have consulted on are:

* Faculty development workshop series to support redesign of the Calculus sequence
* Serving in an advisory capacity for grants in education related areas
* One-on-one and small group consultations with faculty on implementing alternative grading in their course


### Keynote Addresses
I am available for keynote addresses at faculty development events and conferences,
both in-person and virtually.  I strive to make my keynotes engaging and interactive,
and focus on providing relevant takeaways that faculty can use in their courses.  

For many events, I pair a keynote address with a smaller, hands-on workshop for interested
faculty.

### Workshops
My workshops are focused on helping faculty take an idea and, together, think through
how they would actually implement this idea in the course they are teaching.  Workshops typically involve significant time with faculty working in small groups on a scaffolded
series of tasks to help them work through what adaptations they need to make to an idea
so that it is well suited to their particular learners and instructional context. Recent workshop offerings include:

* Team-Based Inquiry Learning
* Active Learning in Mathematics
* Course Policies and Practices for Inclusive Teaching
* Collaborative Learning in Mathematics Classrooms
* Promoting Wellbeing in STEM Classrooms
* Rehumanizing Assessment: Outcomes-Based Grading 
* An Introduction to Team-Based Learning



### Learning Communities
Learning communities involve (usually) weekly meetings of a group of faculty over a series
of several months focused on diving into a particular topic and working with other 
participants to learn and apply the topics.  Most often I run this in partnership with a 
particular institution or organization, such as the [RIOS Institute](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/rios) or the [Center for 
Grading Reform](https://centerforgradingreform.org).


### Grant Consulting
I serve as a consultant on education-related grants in various capacities. This can include
providing professional development programming, leading educational research components of
a grant, evaluation services, grant writing assistance, or serving on an advisory board.  Some funded projects I have been involved with:
- [Motivating Academics for Growth, Innovation, and Collaboration in STEM: a Regional Faculty Learning Community in South Alabama](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2417167)
- [Transforming Lower Division Undergraduate Mathematics Through Team-Based Inquiry Learning](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2011807)
- [Conference: The Grading Conference Higher Education STEM Focus](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2304776)
- [Teaching Critical Thinking & Logical Reasoning in Undergraduate STEM Courses](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2018270)
- [HHMI Inclusive Excellence 3](https://www.hhmi.org/programs/inclusive-excellence-3)
- [Pathway to Mathematics](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1135621)


### Individual and Small Group Consulting
I frequently work with individuals and small groups of faculty to provide advice on
topics such as implementing active learning in their classes, inclusive teaching, and 
alternative grading. This can be either as an individual event, or part of a planned 
programming series at your institution or organization.
